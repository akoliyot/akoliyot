### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Aswin, and I like learning and building stuff.

I'm currently:

- ðŸ“š learning iOS development.
- ðŸ”­ working on a momentum based habit tracker for iOS and Apple Watch

Some of the stuff I've created:

- [wallhaven](https://github.com/akoliyot/wallhaven): a wallpaper app for Windows Phone 8.1.
- [entry-to-deutsch](https://entry-to-deutsch.netlify.app/): helps you practise your German alphabet pronunciation.
